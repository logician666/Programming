    "* Your task is to build a multifunction device (MFD) class consisting of  \n",
    "methods responsible for document scanning, printing, and sending via fax.\n",
    "* The methods are delivered by the following classes:\n",
    "    * `scan()`, delivered by the `Scanner` class;\n",
    "    * `print()`, delivered by the `Printer` class;\n",
    "    * `send()` and `print()`, delivered by the `Fax` class.\n",
    "* Each method should print a message indicating its purpose and origin, like:\n",
    "    * 'print() method from Printer class'\n",
    "    * 'send() method from Fax class'\n",
    "* create an `MFD_SPF` class ('SPF' means 'Scanner', 'Printer', 'Fax'), then instantiate it;\n",
    "* create an `MFD_SFP` class ('SFP' means 'Scanner', 'Fax', 'Printer'), then instantiate it;\n",
    "* on each object call the methods: `scan()`, `print()`, `send()`;\n",
    "* observe the output differences. Was the Printer class utilized each time?"
